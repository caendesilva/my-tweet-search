# My Tweet Search

**Simple tool to quickly find Tweets with Advanced Search**

Looking for that specific tweet you wrote a while ago?
This simple tool provides a nicer wrapper for the Twitter Advanced Search to quickly find it.

This tool does not save any of your data, and it has no backend. For your convenience, it uses Local Storage to remember your Twitter handle.
